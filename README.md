# twitter-crawler-r
A set of R scripts to crawl through Twitter accounts and generate a social network

This set of R scripts lets you start with a seed Twitter account and then download all connected Twitter account profile data (either friends or followers).

To be able to run these scripts, you need to have a Twitter API key.
